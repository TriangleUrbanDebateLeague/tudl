			<h1>Coaching</h1>

			<p>For many communities, the financial burden of debate proves too great a challenge to overcome, and debate programs may be poor or nonexistent.  TUDL solves this problem by providing free high quality Congressional Debate Coaching to public high schools.</p>

			<br>

			<h1>Tournaments</h1>
			<p>Often, Debate tournaments are located a considerable distance from public high schools.  Those without the resources to provide transportation for their students are unable to compete in tournaments.  TUDL provides several free local tournaments with transportation each year to participant schools.</p>

			<br>

			<h1>Impacts</h1>
			<p>Participating in speech and debate throughout high school dramatically improves studentsâ€™ life outcomes.  From being more likely to graduate high school, pursue higher education, and give back to communities, speech and debate fosters invaluable personal growth.</p>
